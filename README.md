A tool to write literature the way you write code.

## Name highlighting

TODO

- You need to save the proze file to the project before highlighting of names and errors is applied.
  This is because the extension needs to know which config file to pull the names from. The extension
  does this by using the path of the file saved on disk and finding the related config using the file path.
